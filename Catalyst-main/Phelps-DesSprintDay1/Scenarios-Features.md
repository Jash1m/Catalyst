## Scenarios

### Greg

Greg is a first-semester senior at UNCC studying computer science with a concentration and a passion for AI and Machine Learning. After looking over many job boards and talking to his professors at the college, Greg realizes that to pursue a job in the field of AI, he will need to be confident with TensorFlow and PyTourch.

After discussing his fear of being unprepared for job interviews with his advisor, Greg's advisor informs him about the Catalyst platform, where he can develop the skills needed to feel confident for any job interview. Greg's advisor directs him to the Catalyst home page and tells him to look around the site and gauge his feelings. When Greg gets home after class, he goes to the Catalyst home page and browses AI-related courses. Seeing a course that teaches TensorFlow, Greg begins the course.

After a couple of lessons in the course, Greg realizes that his knowledge of linear algebra is not what it should be to keep learning. However, Catalyst has already picked up on this and has dynamically inserted linear algebra lessons into his TensorFlow lesson plan. After multiple weeks of working on the program daily, Greg began to build projects utilizing TensorFlow. The Catalyst system grades these projects, so Greg learns when his logic is skewed and where he needs to work on syntax and code formatting.

After completing the course on TensorFlow, Greg feels very confident in the software, and his increased knowledge of linear algebra has helped him improve his grades in his studies at UNCC. Greg eventually graduates from UNCC and, after preparing for interviews in his desired field with Catalyst, lands a great job at his dream company.

### Johanna

Johanna recently graduated with her degree in mathematics from UNCC. Johanna is passionate about data science but needs to gain the professional skills and knowledge to enter the job market. After voicing her concerns to a friend in a similar situation, Johanna is directed to the Catalyst platform.

Johanna enrolls in statistics for data science and a Python course to bridge her knowledge gap. As Sarach progresses in her courses, she is dissatisfied with the lack of theory the courses provide; being a math major, she learns best when more theory is involved. Johanna realizes that after each lesson, there is an option to customize the course material. She sets the course up to teach from a more theoretical standpoint and is immediately satisfied.

After completing multiple graded projects with the Catalyst system, Johanna feels confident in her skills and her project portfolio. She landed an entry-level data science role at a local company in Charlotte.

## User Stories
